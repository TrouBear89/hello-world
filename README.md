# hello-world


Greetings Terra-3 Life Forms!

I'm just an alien, traveling around and observing different planets and their many inhabitants. My ship broke down a while ago and I have been waiting for rescue ever since. The Mothership is late. Hopefully, they weren't captured or worse... Hopefully, they haven't forgotten about me.
